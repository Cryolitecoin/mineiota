Live on: [https://mineiota.com](https://mineiota.com/)

##  How it Works
* When you are mining monero, you also get as reward shares in PIVX staking pool. This will build you passive income of the iota from staking.
* Mineiota.com run PIVX staking node, when node mint new block is rewarded with 2 PIVX. It is represented as 200 000 000 new shares in pool (Smallest unit of PIVX is 0.00000001, it is equal to 1 share). 
* You get additional shares by portion of your actual shares in PIVX staking pool. For example if pool staking 1000 PIVX. It is equal to 100 000 000 000 shares and you own
10 000 shares (0,0001 PIVX). Your reward from minted block is (200 000 000 / 100 000 000 000) * 10 000 = 2O new shares. Now you are staking with 10 020 shares.
* You can anytime exchange your PIVX shares for IOTA by actual binance.com rate minus 5% fee for handle price volatility. If price is 0,0001750 PIVX/BTC and 0.00009007 MillionIOTA/BTC. Your 0,00010020 PIVX is exchanged to 0,000000017535 BTC and then with price 0,00000000009007 for 1 iota to 194 iota. This minus 9 iota fee will be send to your iota address.

##  Why PIVX staking pool?
It is example how get passively more iota by staking another crypto coin, which you earned as reward from mining different proof of work coin. It is also for teaching purpose to show benefits of feeless IOTA network. Because with PIVX even with low burned fees, it is imposible send you so small reward. But with IOTA it is possible.
* PIVX have most advanced, secure, instant, anonymous, green, deflationary blockchain network. In short PIVX is in my view second the best technology crypto coin after IOTA.

### What is PIVX?
* Blockchain tech using a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus system algorithm allowing all owners of PIVX to participate in earning block rewards while securing the network with full node wallets.
* First proof of stake coin with the zerocoin protocol (called zPIV).
* Most important part block rewards are static and inflation is reduced whenever a transaction is included in a block by burning transaction & zerocoin fees. At a certain threshold combination of transactions per minute, PIVX will become deflationary.
